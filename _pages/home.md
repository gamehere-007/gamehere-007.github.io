My name is Zhilu Lai, currently a Senior Assistant at ETH-Zurich and Singapore-ETH Centre. I will be joining [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/home) as a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor, starting from 09.2022. The research group (temporarily named "Z Lab"), based in the new [Guangzhou Campus](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/), will be focusing on theoretical, analytical, and experimental studies for developing innovative methodologies of assimilating sensor data into the modeling, condition assessment, diagnostics, and virtualization of engineered systems.


 **We are  looking for passionate new PhD students, Postdocs, and Master students to join the team** [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/vacancies) **!**
