My name is Zhilu Lai, currently a Senior Assistant at [ETH-Z&uuml;rich and Singapore-ETH Centre](https://frs.ethz.ch/people/researchers/lai-zhilu.html). I will be joining [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/home), [IoT Thrust](https://infh.hkust-gz.edu.cn/en/academics/iot), as a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor, starting from 09.2022. The research group (temporarily named "Z Lab"), will be based in the new [Guangzhou Campus](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/).


The advancements of sensing technology, data mining, and artificial intelligence have accelerated the development of tools and platforms for next-generation civil infrastructure and engineered systems, paving the way towards developing smart cities and cyber-physical systems. The groupâ€™s research works (including theoretical, analytical, and experimental studies) aim to develop the fusion of physical models and sensor data into the modeling, assessment, and diagnostics of engineered systems, with providing intelligent solutions for effectuating more resilient, adaptive, and senseable infrastructure systems.

Approaching this direction, the relevant **research interest** is summarized into the directions of:

* scientific machine learning; physics-informed machine learning
* deep learning for engineered systems
* computer vision-based infrastructural monitoring; advanced sensing technologies
* structural health monitoring


 **We are  looking for passionate new PhD students, Postdocs, and Master students to join the team** [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/vacancies) **!** **If you are interested in our group, please send your CV to** [laiz@ethz.ch](mailto:laiz@ethz.ch)


We are grateful for funding from HKUST(GZ)
