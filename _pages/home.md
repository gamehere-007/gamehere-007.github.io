We are a dynamic research group at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/home), based in the new [Guangzhou Campus](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/). Our research work includes theoretical, analytical, and experimental studies for developing innovative methodologies of assimilating sensor data into the modeling, condition assessment, diagnostics, and virtualization of engineered systems.
